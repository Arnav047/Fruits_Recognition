### Fruits Recognition Using CNN
Dataset properties:
The total number of images: 90483.

Training set size: 67692 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).

Test set size: 22688 images (one fruit or vegetable per image).

The number of classes: 131 (fruits and vegetables).

Image size: 100x100 pixels.

### Proposed Solutions
* Created a CNN model using Tensorflow to classify the fruits based on the image presented by dealing with the dataset containing images of fruits.
* Classifying fruits from the fruits images using EfficientNetB3 Architecture and achieved an accuracy of 98%.
* Real Time Prediction by inputting the fruit label we want and getting output as image of the fruit we inputted

### TechStack Used:
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pathlib
* Sklearn
* Keras
